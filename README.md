My implementation of OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers in a range of usecases as part of a portfolio exam for a class on OpenCV in C++.  As such it should be considered part of a learning experience and by no means a best practice when it comes to use of the OpenCV libraries, Haar Cascade classifiers or C++ in general.
